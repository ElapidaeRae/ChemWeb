= Evaluation

ChemWeb is a website that allows users to create and share methods for chemical reactions. It is a novel solution to a problem that has not been addressed before, and it has the potential to be a valuable resource for chemists and researchers. 
The website is built using modern technologies and libraries that allow for a modular development process.


== Functionality
The website allows users to create accounts that are stored in a database. These accounts can be used to create and share methods for chemical reactions.
A user with a user account is able to create their own methods to share with other users. 



== Future Improvements
There are many potential improvements that could be considered for ChemWeb. Some of these include:
- Adding a search function to allow users to find methods more easily.
- Adding email verification to ensure that users are using valid email addresses.
- Adding a rating system to allow users to rate methods and provide feedback.
- Adding password reset functionality to send a reset password email to users on request.

If I were to continue working on ChemWeb, I would consider implementing these features in order to improve the user experience and make the website more of a useful tool for its users.

// However I will never be touching this project again as I have hated every second of it. Good riddance to this loathsome project and all the stress it has caused me.

// I'll be glad to finally be able to work on something that I actually care about.
